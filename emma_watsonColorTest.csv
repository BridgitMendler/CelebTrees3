2,@stringimiloueh,The boy I was dating didn't want to stay with me in front of his friends so yesterday I texted him "we're over" and his answer was "?". From that moment he is ignoring me at all. What should I do?,1,#4E5DAF,0
3,@QuietIntrovert, I'm not Emma but it sounds like you should send him a message explaining why you ended it. In any type of relationship romantic or not communication is key. Let him know how his actions made you feel. No guarantees but maybe he will talk to you after.,2,#9ACD32,0
4,@kiradot00,But it sounds like you ended it for good reason! Stay strong ‚ù§,2,#9ACD32,0

11,@caroline_wilby,I wish all of my break ups were that easy!! Guys don't normally get the message that it's over!!,2,#6ACFF8,0
12,@Coops_Momma,Just let it go and find someone that wants to be seen with you.  Life is too short and everyone deserves to be loved and not ignored.,2,#9ACD32,0
13,@Allerdice_,Never talk to him again,2,#FFA500,0
14,@stringimiloueh,Already done weeks ago he said sorry but he continued,3,#4E5DAF,0
15,@QuietIntrovert,Then maybe he's not worth the time. We all deserve someone who will welcome us into their lives not push us aside when other people are there. I'm not saying he can't have time with his friends without you there but he shouldn't exclude you when you're around. Not worth it.,14,#9ACD32,0

23,@QuietIntrovert,Maybe he's worth it for someone else but not you. So go about your life make yourself happy and keep looking for the person that /is/ worth it. That person is out there but the universe is saying "Not yet.",21,#9ACD32,0
24,@GrahamLower,Beans. Lots of them. Eat them. It will solve itself.,21,#9ACD32,0
25,@extra_jams,If i was you 1- block his number and delete if needed and avaible (my ex is a colleague so sometimes i still need his number) 2- if you have to talk to him in person do it in a public place. Make it clear. 3- live your life. Forgeting him is the best you could do,21,#9ACD32,0
26,@extra_jams,You kinda of described my ex. It was not that much tho but he'd always pick his friends over me. We stopped talking for a few weeks after breaking up but our relationship is very healthy now. Not saying were bff but it's healthy.,25,#9ACD32,0

41,@angelodou,Which is good. Problems are there to be solved. Ending the relationship without thinking about a solution (together) is just running away from your problems.I don't know your particular situation but in general I'd prefer someone who actually cares about a relationship.,11,#FFA500,0
